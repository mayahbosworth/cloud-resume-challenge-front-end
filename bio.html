                    <p>As soon as I learned how to walk, I had a soccer ball at my feet. Between the ages of 6 and 18, I played competitively in Southern California. I grew up dedicating so much time to the sport and absolutely fell in love with the game. Through soccer, I learned invaluable lessons about teamwork, resilience, and leadership. On the field, I took pride in being a compassionate leader who supported my team with empathy and understanding. This journey profoundly shaped my leadership abilities and personal growth.</p>

                <hr class="content-divider">
                <p>At 14, I started to coach soccer. I began coaching private training sessions for kids aged 4-8. In 2021, I was able to coach the girls varsity team at Vistamar High School. These experiences, spanning from private sessions to team coaching, taught me invaluable lessons in patience, adaptability, and effective communication. These experiences shaped me into not just a leader who strives for victory, but one who ensures every member feels heard and supported.</p>

                <p>I've always been deeply passionate about mental health, driven by a deep understanding of its importance in our lives. My interest was ignited by personal experiences and observations, leading me to actively seek knowledge and engage in conversations about mental well-being. This passion has motivated me to advocate for greater awareness and support systems in my community. I'm committed to breaking the stigma surrounding mental health and encouraging open, supportive dialogues to foster a more understanding and compassionate society.</p>

                <hr class="content-divider">
                <p>My volunteer experiences have been deeply enriching and diverse, and have sparked my passion for community service. At a daycare center called KidsWorks in Santa Ana, I engaged with children from economically challenged communities. I provided them with care and activities to ensure a safe environment for development. My journey also took me to Tijuana, where I spoke (very broken) Spanish with deportees and immigrants, served them dinner, and connected with them about their complex experiences. Although these are just a couple of examples, I can confidently say that all of my volunteer experiences have been instrumental in shaping my understanding of diverse community needs and the power of compassionate service.</p>
